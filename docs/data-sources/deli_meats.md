  A savory data source that provides a complete catalog of available deli meats. Learn how to query data sources to discover available options before creating your meat resources.
  Example Usage:
  
  # Get all available deli meats
  data "hw_deli_meats" "available" {}
  
  # Create meat resources for each available type
  resource "hw_meat" "all_types" {
    for_each = toset(data.hw_deli_meats.available.meats)
    
    kind        = each.value
    description = "Deli meat: ${each.value}"
  }
  
  # Use in outputs
  output "available_meats" {
    value = data.hw_deli_meats.available.meats
  }
  
  # Filter meats based on criteria
  locals {
    all_meats     = data.hw_deli_meats.available.meats
    poultry_meats = [

# hw_deli_meats (Data Source)

A savory data source that provides a complete catalog of available deli meats. Learn how to query data sources to discover available options before creating your meat resources.

**Example Usage:**

```hcl
# Get all available deli meats
data "hw_deli_meats" "available" {}

# Create meat resources for each available type
resource "hw_meat" "all_types" {
  for_each = toset(data.hw_deli_meats.available.meats)
  
  kind        = each.value
  description = "Deli meat: ${each.value}"
}

# Use in outputs
output "available_meats" {
  value = data.hw_deli_meats.available.meats
}

# Filter meats based on criteria
locals {
  all_meats     = data.hw_deli_meats.available.meats
  poultry_meats = [
    for meat in local.all_meats : meat
    if contains(["turkey", "chicken"], meat)
  ]
}

# Create only poultry sandwiches
resource "hw_bread" "rye" {
  kind = "rye"
}

resource "hw_sandwich" "poultry" {
  for_each = toset(local.poultry_meats)
  
  bread_id = hw_bread.rye.id
  meat_id  = hw_meat.all_types[each.value].id
  description = "${each.value} sandwich on rye"
}

# Count available meats
output "meat_count" {
  value = length(data.hw_deli_meats.available.meats)
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Demonstrates **data sources for discovery**
- Returns a list of available meat types
- Perfect for dynamic resource creation with `for_each`
- Use `data.hw_deli_meats.available.meats` to access the list

*Sliced thin and ready,*
*Meats arrayed in perfect rows,*
*Choices abound here.*
