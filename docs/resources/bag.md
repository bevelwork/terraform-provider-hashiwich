# hw_bag (Resource)

A versatile container resource that holds multiple sandwiches, perfect for takeout orders or meal prep. The bag resource demonstrates list attributes and resource references, allowing you to group sandwiches together for convenient management and organization.

**Example Usage:**

```hcl
# Create bread and meat resources first
resource "hw_bread" "rye" {
  kind = "rye"
}

resource "hw_meat" "turkey" {
  kind = "turkey"
}

resource "hw_meat" "ham" {
  kind = "ham"
}

# Create sandwiches
resource "hw_sandwich" "turkey_sandwich" {
  bread_id = hw_bread.rye.id
  meat_id   = hw_meat.turkey.id
}

resource "hw_sandwich" "ham_sandwich" {
  bread_id = hw_bread.rye.id
  meat_id  = hw_meat.ham.id
}

# Create a bag containing multiple sandwiches
resource "hw_bag" "lunch_bag" {
  description = "Lunch bag with multiple sandwiches"
  sandwiches  = [
    hw_sandwich.turkey_sandwich.id,
    hw_sandwich.ham_sandwich.id
  ]
}

# Using for_each to create multiple bags
resource "hw_bag" "party_bags" {
  for_each = toset(["bag1", "bag2", "bag3"])
  
  description = "Party bag ${each.key}"
  sandwiches  = [hw_sandwich.turkey_sandwich.id]
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Demonstrates **list attributes** with resource references
- Shows how to group related resources together
- Useful for managing collections of items
- The `sandwiches` attribute accepts a list of sandwich resource IDs
