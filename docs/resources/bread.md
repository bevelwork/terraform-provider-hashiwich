# hw_bread (Resource)

The `hw_bread` resource represents a type of bread available in the sandwich shop.

This resource is used to create bread instances that can then be referenced by other resources like `hw_sandwich`. Each bread resource has a unique identifier (ID) that is automatically generated based on the bread kind.

**Example Usage:**

```hcl
resource "hw_bread" "rye" {
  kind        = "rye"
  description = "Fresh rye bread"
}

resource "hw_bread" "sourdough" {
  kind        = "sourdough"
  description = "Artisan sourdough bread"
}
```

**Common Bread Types:**
- `rye` - Classic rye bread
- `sourdough` - Tangy sourdough bread
- `wheat` - Whole wheat bread
- `ciabatta` - Italian ciabatta bread
- `white` - White bread
- `multigrain` - Multigrain bread

**Note:** The `kind` attribute accepts any string value, but using common bread types makes your configuration more readable. The resource ID is automatically computed and cannot be set manually.

## Schema

### Required

- `kind` (String) The type or variety of bread. This is a required field that identifies what kind of bread this resource represents.

**Type:** `string` (required)

**Examples:**
```hcl
kind = "rye"
kind = "sourdough"
kind = "whole wheat"
```

**Common Values:**
- `rye`, `sourdough`, `wheat`, `ciabatta`, `white`, `multigrain`

**Important Notes:**
- This value is used to generate the resource ID
- Changing this value will cause the resource to be recreated (new ID generated)
- The value is case-sensitive
- Any string value is accepted, but using standard bread types improves readability

### Optional

- `description` (String) Optional human-readable description of the bread resource.

This field is useful for documentation and can help identify the purpose or characteristics of the bread in your configuration.

**Example:**
```hcl
description = "Fresh-baked daily rye bread with caraway seeds"
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive text that helps understand the bread's purpose
- Can be used in outputs or documentation
- Does not affect resource behavior or ID generation

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Automatically generated unique identifier for this bread resource.

**Type:** `string` (computed, read-only)

**Format:** `bread-{kind}-{length}`

**Example Values:**
- `bread-rye-3` (for kind = "rye")
- `bread-sourdough-9` (for kind = "sourdough")

**Important Notes:**
- This value is automatically computed and cannot be set manually
- The ID is stable and will not change unless the `kind` attribute changes
- Use this ID to reference the bread in other resources (e.g., `hw_sandwich.bread_id`)
- The ID format includes the bread kind and the length of the kind string
