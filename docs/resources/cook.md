  The skilled artisan who brings your sandwiches to life. This resource demonstrates how experience levels affect both cost and efficiency, teaching conditional logic and computed attributes based on skill tiers.

# hw_cook (Resource)

The skilled artisan who brings your sandwiches to life. This resource demonstrates how experience levels affect both cost and efficiency, teaching conditional logic and computed attributes based on skill tiers.

resource "hw_cook" "junior" {
  name        = "Alex"
  experience  = "junior"
  description = "Junior cook starting out"

}

# Experienced cook
resource "hw_cook" "experienced" {
  name        = "Sam"
  experience  = "experienced"

}

# Expert cook
resource "hw_cook" "expert" {
  name        = "Jordan"
  experience  = "expert"
  description = "Expert chef"
  # cost computed as $200/day
}

# Multiple cooks for a store
resource "hw_cook" "team" {
  for_each = {
    cook1 = { name = "Alice", experience = "junior" }
    cook2 = { name = "Bob", experience = "experienced" }
    cook3 = { name = "Charlie", experience = "expert" }
  }
  
  name        = each.value.name
  experience  = each.value.experience
  description = "${each.value.name} - ${each.value.experience} cook"
}
```
