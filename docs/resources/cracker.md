# hw_cracker (Resource)

A crunchy companion resource perfect for soups and spreads. Demonstrates how simple resources with quantity-based pricing can be managed efficiently in Terraform configurations.

**Example Usage:**

```hcl
# Saltine crackers
resource "hw_cracker" "saltines" {
  kind     = "saltine"
  quantity = 5
  description = "Classic saltine crackers"
}

# Graham crackers
resource "hw_cracker" "graham" {
  kind     = "graham"
  quantity = 3
  description = "Graham crackers for s'mores"
}

# Using for_each to create multiple cracker types
variable "cracker_orders" {
  type = map(number)
  default = {
    saltine = 10
    oyster  = 5
    graham  = 8
  }
}

resource "hw_cracker" "menu" {
  for_each = var.cracker_orders
  
  kind     = each.key
  quantity = each.value
  description = "${each.value} packs of ${each.key} crackers"
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Demonstrates **string and number attributes** together
- Shows **quantity-based pricing** ($0.50 per pack)
- Useful for learning resource attributes
- Price = quantity × $0.50

*Golden and crisp,*
*Snapping with each bite,*
*The perfect crunch.*
