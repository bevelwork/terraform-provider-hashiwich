    description = "Treat for a very good dog"
    # size will be computed as "large"

# hw_dogtreat (Resource)

A special resource that rewards good behavior! Demonstrates conditional logic and computed attributes based on boolean values. The size of the treat depends entirely on whether the dog has been good.

**Example Usage:**

```hcl
# Good dog gets large treat
resource "hw_dogtreat" "good_dog" {
  is_good_dog = true
  description = "Treat for a very good dog"
  # size will be computed as "large"
  # price will be computed as $2.00
}

# Not-so-good dog gets small treat
resource "hw_dogtreat" "needs_work" {
  is_good_dog = false
  description = "Small treat for training"
  # size will be computed as "small"
  # price will be computed as $1.00
}

# Using variables for conditional logic
variable "dog_behavior" {
  type = map(bool)
  default = {
    max    = true
    buddy  = true
    rover  = false
  }
}

resource "hw_dogtreat" "pack" {
  for_each = var.dog_behavior
  
  is_good_dog = each.value
  description = "Treat for ${each.key} (${each.value ? "good" : "needs work"})"
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Demonstrates **boolean attributes** and conditional logic
- Shows **computed attributes** based on boolean values
- If `is_good_dog = true`: size = "large", price = $2.00
- If `is_good_dog = false`: size = "small", price = $1.00

*Wagging tail awaits,*
*Good dogs get the bigger treat,*
*Joy in every bite.*

## Schema

### Required

- `is_good_dog` (Boolean) Whether the dog is a good dog. If true, the treat will be large; if false, it will be small.

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description of the dog treat resource

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Dog treat identifier
- `price` (Number) The price of the dog treat in dollars (large: $2.00, small: $1.00)
- `size` (String) The size of the treat (large or small), determined by is_good_dog
