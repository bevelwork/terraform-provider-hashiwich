# hw_drink (Resource)

The `hw_drink` resource represents a beverage available in the sandwich shop.

This resource demonstrates **nested blocks** in Terraform through the optional `ice` block, which allows configuring ice preferences. The ice block is a list that can contain multiple ice configuration objects, making it ideal for learning about `dynamic` blocks.

**Example Usage:**

```hcl
# Simple drink without ice configuration
resource "hw_drink" "cola" {
  kind        = "cola"
  description = "Classic cola"
}

# Drink with ice configuration using nested blocks
resource "hw_drink" "soda_with_ice" {
  kind        = "soda"
  description = "Soda with ice"
  
  ice {
    some = true
  }
}

# Multiple ice blocks (demonstrates list blocks)
resource "hw_drink" "soda_multiple_ice" {
  kind = "soda"
  
  ice {
    some = true
  }
  
  ice {
    lots = true
  }
}
```

**Common Drink Types:**
- `cola`, `soda`, `juice`, `water`, `lemonade`

**Learning Concepts:**
- **Nested Blocks**: The `ice` block demonstrates how to use nested configuration blocks
- **Dynamic Blocks**: Use `dynamic` blocks to conditionally create ice configurations
- **List Blocks**: The ice block is a list, allowing multiple ice configurations

*Cool liquid refreshment,*
*Ice cubes clinking in the glass,*
*Quenching every thirst.*

## Schema

### Required

- `kind` (String) The type or variety of beverage. This is a required field that identifies what kind of drink this resource represents.

**Type:** `string` (required)

**Examples:**
```hcl
kind = "cola"
kind = "soda"
kind = "juice"
kind = "water"
```

**Common Values:**
- `cola`, `soda`, `juice`, `water`, `lemonade`, `iced tea`

**Important Notes:**
- This value is used to generate the resource ID
- Changing this value will cause the resource to be recreated (new ID generated)
- The value is case-sensitive
- Any string value is accepted

### Optional

- `description` (String) Optional human-readable description of the drink resource.

**Type:** `string` (optional)

**Example:**
```hcl
description = "Refreshing cola beverage"
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive text that helps understand the drink's purpose
- Can be used in outputs or documentation
- Does not affect resource behavior or pricing
- `ice` (Block List) Optional nested block for configuring ice preferences. This is a **list block**, meaning you can specify multiple `ice` blocks.

**Type:** `list(object)` (optional)

**Learning Purpose:**
This block demonstrates several Terraform concepts:
- **Nested Blocks**: How to structure complex configuration
- **List Blocks**: Multiple blocks of the same type
- **Dynamic Blocks**: Use `dynamic "ice"` to conditionally create ice configurations

**Example Usage:**

```hcl
# Single ice block
ice {
  some = true
}

# Multiple ice blocks (list)
ice {
  some = true
}
ice {
  lots = true
}

# Using dynamic blocks
dynamic "ice" {
  for_each = var.include_ice ? [1] : []
  content {
    some = true
  }
}
```

**Block Attributes:**
- `some` (bool, optional): Request some ice
- `lots` (bool, optional): Request lots of ice
- `max` (bool, optional): Request maximum ice

**Best Practices:**
- Use `dynamic` blocks when ice configuration is conditional
- Only set one of the boolean attributes to `true` per block
- This block is optional - drinks can be created without ice configuration (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--ice))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Automatically generated unique identifier for this drink resource.

**Type:** `string` (computed, read-only)

**Format:** `drink-{kind}-{length}`

**Example Values:**
- `drink-cola-4` (for kind = "cola")
- `drink-soda-4` (for kind = "soda")

**Important Notes:**
- This value is automatically computed and cannot be set manually
- The ID is stable and will not change unless the `kind` attribute changes
- Use this ID to reference the drink in other resources or outputs
- `price` (Number) The price of the drink in dollars. This is a computed value that includes the base price plus any provider-level upcharge.

**Type:** `number` (computed, read-only)

**Base Price:** $1.00

**Pricing Logic:**
- Base price: $1.00 (fixed for all drinks)
- Provider upcharge: Added if `upcharge` is configured in the provider block
- Final price = $1.00 + upcharge amount

**Example Values:**
- Without upcharge: `1.00`
- With upcharge of $0.50: `1.50`

**Important Notes:**
- This value is automatically computed and cannot be set manually
- The price is the same for all drinks regardless of kind or ice configuration
- Use this in outputs or calculations for total order costs

### Nested Schema for `ice`

Optional:

- `lots` (Boolean) Set to `true` to request lots of ice in the drink.

**Type:** `bool` (optional)

**Example:**
```hcl
ice {
  lots = true
}
```

**Note:** Only one of `some`, `lots`, or `max` should be set to `true`, though the provider does not enforce this.
- `max` (Boolean) Set to `true` to request maximum ice in the drink.

**Type:** `bool` (optional)

**Example:**
```hcl
ice {
  max = true
}
```

**Note:** Only one of `some`, `lots`, or `max` should be set to `true`, though the provider does not enforce this.
- `some` (Boolean) Set to `true` to request some ice in the drink.

**Type:** `bool` (optional)

**Example:**
```hcl
ice {
  some = true
}
```

**Note:** Only one of `some`, `lots`, or `max` should be set to `true`, though the provider does not enforce this.
