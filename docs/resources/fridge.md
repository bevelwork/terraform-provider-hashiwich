# hw_fridge (Resource)

Essential cold storage that keeps ingredients fresh and ready. Demonstrates size-based resource configuration and cost calculations, teaching how infrastructure components scale with your business needs.

**Example Usage:**

```hcl
# Small fridge
resource "hw_fridge" "small" {
  size        = "small"
  description = "Small fridge for limited space"
  # cost computed as $300
}

# Medium fridge
resource "hw_fridge" "medium" {
  size        = "medium"
  description = "Medium fridge for standard operations"
  # cost computed as $500
}

# Large fridge
resource "hw_fridge" "large" {
  size        = "large"
  description = "Large fridge for high-volume operations"
  # cost computed as $800
}

# Using variables
variable "fridge_size" {
  type    = string
  default = "medium"
}

resource "hw_fridge" "variable" {
  size        = var.fridge_size
  description = "Fridge configured from variable"
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Demonstrates **size-based cost calculation**
- Required for `hw_store` resource
- Sizes: small ($300), medium ($500), large ($800)
- Cost is automatically computed

*Cool air preserves,*
*Fresh ingredients waiting,*
*Silent guardian stands.*
