# hw_meat (Resource)

The `hw_meat` resource represents a type of deli meat available in the sandwich shop.

This resource is used to create meat instances that can then be referenced by other resources like `hw_sandwich`. Each meat resource has a unique identifier (ID) that is automatically generated based on the meat kind.

**Example Usage:**

```hcl
resource "hw_meat" "turkey" {
  kind        = "turkey"
  description = "Premium sliced turkey"
}

resource "hw_meat" "ham" {
  kind        = "ham"
  description = "Honey-glazed ham"
}

resource "hw_meat" "roast_beef" {
  kind        = "roast beef"
  description = "Slow-roasted beef"
}
```

**Common Meat Types:**
- `turkey` - Sliced turkey breast
- `ham` - Deli ham
- `roast beef` - Roast beef
- `chicken` - Grilled chicken
- `pastrami` - Spiced pastrami
- `salami` - Italian salami

**Note:** The `kind` attribute accepts any string value, including multi-word names (e.g., "roast beef"). The resource ID is automatically computed and cannot be set manually.

## Schema

### Required

- `kind` (String) The type or variety of deli meat. This is a required field that identifies what kind of meat this resource represents.

**Type:** `string` (required)

**Examples:**
```hcl
kind = "turkey"
kind = "ham"
kind = "roast beef"  # Multi-word values are supported
```

**Common Values:**
- `turkey`, `ham`, `roast beef`, `chicken`, `pastrami`, `salami`

**Important Notes:**
- This value is used to generate the resource ID
- Changing this value will cause the resource to be recreated (new ID generated)
- The value is case-sensitive
- Multi-word values (e.g., "roast beef") are supported
- Any string value is accepted, but using standard meat types improves readability

### Optional

- `description` (String) Optional human-readable description of the meat resource.

This field is useful for documentation and can help identify the characteristics or quality of the meat in your configuration.

**Example:**
```hcl
description = "Premium organic turkey, sliced thin"
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive text that helps understand the meat's characteristics
- Can be used in outputs or documentation
- Does not affect resource behavior or ID generation

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Automatically generated unique identifier for this meat resource.

**Type:** `string` (computed, read-only)

**Format:** `meat-{kind}-{length}`

**Example Values:**
- `meat-turkey-6` (for kind = "turkey")
- `meat-roast-beef-10` (for kind = "roast beef")

**Important Notes:**
- This value is automatically computed and cannot be set manually
- The ID is stable and will not change unless the `kind` attribute changes
- Use this ID to reference the meat in other resources (e.g., `hw_sandwich.meat_id`)
- The ID format includes the meat kind and the length of the kind string
- Multi-word kinds will have spaces converted to dashes in the ID
