# hw_napkin (Resource)

A humble but essential resource that demonstrates numeric attributes and simple computations. Sometimes the smallest resources teach the biggest lessons about Terraform fundamentals.

**Example Usage:**

```hcl
# Single napkin order
resource "hw_napkin" "small_order" {
  quantity    = 10
  description = "Small napkin order"
}

# Bulk napkin order
resource "hw_napkin" "bulk_order" {
  quantity    = 100
  description = "Bulk napkin order for restaurant"
}

# Using variables for quantity
variable "napkin_quantity" {
  type    = number
  default = 50
}

resource "hw_napkin" "variable_order" {
  quantity    = var.napkin_quantity
  description = "Napkin order from variable"
}

# Calculate total cost in output
output "napkin_total_cost" {
  value = hw_napkin.bulk_order.price
  description = "Total cost for bulk napkin order"
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Demonstrates **numeric attributes** (quantity)
- Shows **computed pricing** ($0.25 per napkin)
- Simple resource perfect for learning basics
- Price = quantity × $0.25

*Soft paper squares,*
*Ready for messy hands,*
*Simple necessity.*
