  The hw_sandwich resource represents a complete sandwich that combines a bread resource and a meat resource.
  This resource demonstrates resource dependencies in Terraform, as it requires existing hw_bread and hw_meat resources to be created first. The sandwich resource automatically computes its name based on the bread and meat types, and sets a fixed price.

# hw_sandwich (Resource)

The `hw_sandwich` resource represents a complete sandwich that combines a bread resource and a meat resource.

This resource demonstrates **resource dependencies** in Terraform, as it requires existing `hw_bread` and `hw_meat` resources to be created first. The sandwich resource automatically computes its name based on the bread and meat types, and sets a fixed price.

**Example Usage:**

```hcl
# First, create the bread and meat resources
resource "hw_bread" "rye" {
  kind = "rye"
}

resource "hw_meat" "turkey" {
  kind = "turkey"
}

# Then create the sandwich using their IDs
resource "hw_sandwich" "turkey_on_rye" {
  bread_id = hw_bread.rye.id
  meat_id  = hw_meat.turkey.id
}
```

**Resource Dependencies:**
- This resource **depends on** `hw_bread` and `hw_meat` resources
- Terraform will automatically create bread and meat resources before creating the sandwich
- If bread_id or meat_id changes, the sandwich will be recreated with a new ID

**Computed Attributes:**
- `name`: Automatically generated as "{meat} on {bread}" (e.g., "turkey on rye")
- `price`: Fixed at $5.00 (plus any provider-level upcharge)
- `id`: Automatically generated unique identifier

*Bread and meat unite,*
*Simple perfection in layers,*
*Lunchtime happiness.*

## Schema

### Required

- `bread_id` (String) The unique identifier (ID) of an existing `hw_bread` resource to use for this sandwich.

**Type:** `string` (required)

**Example:**
```hcl
bread_id = hw_bread.rye.id
bread_id = "bread-rye-3"  # Direct ID reference (not recommended)
```

**Best Practices:**
- Always reference bread resources using `hw_bread.{resource_name}.id` syntax
- This creates an **implicit dependency** - Terraform will create the bread before the sandwich
- Avoid hardcoding IDs directly; use resource references instead

**Important Notes:**
- The bread resource must exist before this sandwich can be created
- Changing this value will cause the sandwich to be recreated (new ID and name generated)
- The bread kind is extracted from the ID to generate the sandwich name
- `meat_id` (String) The unique identifier (ID) of an existing `hw_meat` resource to use for this sandwich.

**Type:** `string` (required)

**Example:**
```hcl
meat_id = hw_meat.turkey.id
meat_id = "meat-turkey-6"  # Direct ID reference (not recommended)
```

**Best Practices:**
- Always reference meat resources using `hw_meat.{resource_name}.id` syntax
- This creates an **implicit dependency** - Terraform will create the meat before the sandwich
- Avoid hardcoding IDs directly; use resource references instead

**Important Notes:**
- The meat resource must exist before this sandwich can be created
- Changing this value will cause the sandwich to be recreated (new ID and name generated)
- The meat kind is extracted from the ID to generate the sandwich name

### Optional

- `description` (String) Optional human-readable description of the sandwich resource.

This field is useful for documentation and can help identify the purpose or characteristics of the sandwich in your configuration.

**Example:**
```hcl
description = "Classic turkey on rye sandwich with premium ingredients"
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive text that helps understand the sandwich's purpose
- Can be used in outputs or documentation
- Does not affect resource behavior, name generation, or pricing

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Automatically generated unique identifier for this sandwich resource.

**Type:** `string` (computed, read-only)

**Format:** `sandwich-{bread_id}-{meat_id}`

**Example Values:**
- `sandwich-bread-rye-3-meat-turkey-6`
- `sandwich-bread-sourdough-9-meat-ham-3`

**Important Notes:**
- This value is automatically computed and cannot be set manually
- The ID is stable and will not change unless `bread_id` or `meat_id` changes
- Use this ID to reference the sandwich in other resources (e.g., `hw_bag.sandwiches`)
- Changing either bread_id or meat_id will cause the resource to be recreated with a new ID
- `name` (String) Automatically generated name of the sandwich in the format "{meat} on {bread}".

**Type:** `string` (computed, read-only)

**Format:** `{meat_kind} on {bread_kind}`

**Example Values:**
- `turkey on rye` (for turkey meat on rye bread)
- `ham on sourdough` (for ham meat on sourdough bread)
- `roast beef on ciabatta` (for roast beef on ciabatta bread)

**How It Works:**
- The name is computed by extracting the kind from the `bread_id` and `meat_id`
- The format is always "{meat} on {bread}" regardless of input order
- The name is stable and will not change unless bread_id or meat_id changes

**Important Notes:**
- This value is automatically computed and cannot be set manually
- Changing `bread_id` or `meat_id` will regenerate the name
- Use this in outputs to display human-readable sandwich names
- `price` (Number) The price of the sandwich in dollars. This is a computed value that includes the base price plus any provider-level upcharge.

**Type:** `number` (computed, read-only)

**Base Price:** $5.00

**Pricing Logic:**
- Base price: $5.00 (fixed for all sandwiches)
- Provider upcharge: Added if `upcharge` is configured in the provider block
- Final price = $5.00 + upcharge amount

**Example Values:**
- Without upcharge: `5.00`
- With upcharge of $0.50: `5.50`
- With upcharge of $1.00: `6.00`

**Important Notes:**
- This value is automatically computed and cannot be set manually
- The price is the same for all sandwiches regardless of bread or meat type
- Use this in outputs or calculations for total order costs
