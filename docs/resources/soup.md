# hw_soup (Resource)

A comforting bowl of warmth that demonstrates string attributes and computed values. Perfect for learning Terraform basics while imagining a cozy meal on a chilly day.

**Example Usage:**

```hcl
# Hot soup example
resource "hw_soup" "tomato_soup" {
  kind        = "tomato"
  temperature = "hot"
  description = "Classic tomato soup"
}

# Cold soup example
resource "hw_soup" "gazpacho" {
  kind        = "gazpacho"
  temperature = "cold"
  description = "Chilled Spanish gazpacho"
}

# Using for_each to create multiple soups
variable "soup_menu" {
  type = map(object({
    kind        = string
    temperature = string
  }))
  default = {
    chicken_noodle = {
      kind        = "chicken noodle"
      temperature = "hot"
    }
    vegetable = {
      kind        = "vegetable"
      temperature = "hot"
    }
    vichyssoise = {
      kind        = "vichyssoise"
      temperature = "cold"
    }
  }
}

resource "hw_soup" "menu" {
  for_each = var.soup_menu
  
  kind        = each.value.kind
  temperature = each.value.temperature
  description = "${each.value.kind} soup (${each.value.temperature})"
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Demonstrates **string attributes** for kind and temperature
- Shows **computed price** attribute (always $2.50)
- Useful for learning basic resource structure
- Temperature must be "hot" or "cold"

*Steam rises gently,*
*Bowl of warmth in cold hands,*
*Comfort in each spoon.*

- `temperature` (String) The temperature of the soup (hot or cold)

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description of the soup resource

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Soup identifier
- `price` (Number) The price of the soup in dollars (hardcoded to $2.50)
