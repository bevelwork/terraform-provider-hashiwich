# hw_store (Resource)

The complete sandwich shop resource that brings together all components into a functioning business. Demonstrates complex resource dependencies, list attributes, and computed values that aggregate costs and calculate capacity from multiple child resources.

**Example Usage:**

```hcl
# First, create all required components
resource "hw_oven" "main" {
  type        = "commercial"
  description = "Main kitchen oven"
}

resource "hw_cook" "chef1" {
  name        = "Alice"
  experience  = "expert"
  description = "Head chef"
}

resource "hw_cook" "chef2" {
  name        = "Bob"
  experience  = "experienced"
  description = "Sous chef"
}

resource "hw_tables" "dining" {
  quantity    = 10
  size        = "medium"
  description = "Dining room tables"
}

resource "hw_chairs" "seating" {
  quantity    = 40
  style       = "comfortable"
  description = "Dining room chairs"
}

resource "hw_fridge" "storage" {
  size        = "large"
  description = "Main storage fridge"
}

# Create the complete store
resource "hw_store" "main" {
  name        = "Downtown Deli"
  oven_id     = hw_oven.main.id
  cook_ids    = [hw_cook.chef1.id, hw_cook.chef2.id]
  tables_id   = hw_tables.dining.id
  chairs_id   = hw_chairs.seating.id
  fridge_id   = hw_fridge.storage.id
  description = "Main downtown location"
  
  # cost and customers_per_hour are automatically computed
}

# Output the store details
output "store_info" {
  value = {
    name              = hw_store.main.name
    total_cost        = hw_store.main.cost
    customers_per_hour = hw_store.main.customers_per_hour
  }
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Demonstrates **complex resource dependencies**
- Requires: oven, at least one cook, tables, chairs, and fridge
- Shows **list attributes** (cook_ids can have multiple cooks)
- Computes total cost from all components
- Calculates customers_per_hour based on capacity

*All pieces unite,*
*Kitchen, staff, and seating,*
*Shop comes to life.*
