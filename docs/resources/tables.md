# hw_tables (Resource)

The foundation of dining space, where customers gather to enjoy their meals. Demonstrates quantity-based resources, size variations, and capacity calculations that scale with your restaurant's needs.

**Example Usage:**

```hcl
# Small tables (2 seats each)
resource "hw_tables" "small" {
  quantity    = 10
  size        = "small"
  description = "Small tables for intimate dining"
  # cost computed as $500 (10 × $50)
  # capacity computed as 20 (10 × 2 seats)
}

# Medium tables (4 seats each)
resource "hw_tables" "medium" {
  quantity    = 8
  size        = "medium"
  description = "Medium tables for groups"
  # cost computed as $800 (8 × $100)
  # capacity computed as 32 (8 × 4 seats)
}

# Large tables (6 seats each)
resource "hw_tables" "large" {
  quantity    = 5
  size        = "large"
  description = "Large tables for big parties"
  # cost computed as $750 (5 × $150)
  # capacity computed as 30 (5 × 6 seats)
}

# Using variables
variable "table_config" {
  type = object({
    quantity = number
    size     = string
  })
  default = {
    quantity = 12
    size     = "medium"
  }
}

resource "hw_tables" "variable" {
  quantity    = var.table_config.quantity
  size        = var.table_config.size
  description = "Tables from variable configuration"
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Demonstrates **quantity and size-based calculations**
- Required for `hw_store` resource
- Sizes: small (2 seats, $50/table), medium (4 seats, $100/table), large (6 seats, $150/table)
- Cost and capacity are automatically computed

*Wooden surfaces wait,*
*Ready for plates and laughter,*
*Gathering place set.*
